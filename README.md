## Disclaimer

This is not an official government project. This is not associated in any way with my employer. I am not getting paid to do this. Also, I have no intentions of making money from this. This is created to keep people informed about the current state of Covid-19 in the country. If you need help, please call the emergency numbers listed on the [website here](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) or call 100.

If you feel any information is missing or there is any error, please feel free to create [an issue](https://github.com/anamritraj/livecovid.in-webapp/issues/new) or reach out to me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anamritraj) and I would be happy to assist.

## Credits

This would not have been possible without the awesome guys at https://github.com/covid19india. I was initially scraping the MoHFW website, but then I got to know about them and since then this project internally calls their API. They are doing really awesome work maintaining a crowdsorced data-base of patients. Thanks to them for all the hard work!
